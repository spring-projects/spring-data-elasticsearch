/**
 * No words â€“ No words can describe this piece of code and why we cannot opt-in/opt-out from JarHell check.
 * <p/>
 * Elasticsearch wants to raise awareness if there are two classes with the exact same name (class name and package
 * name) to avoid downstream issues. Turns out, in some case, such as Java 9 module descriptors, it's perfectly fine to
 * have exactly same class names (such as {@code module-info.class}) yet JarHell goes awry and prevents startup.
 * <p>
 * This class is here to be loaded before ES's JarHell class and to anyone that wants to survive JarHell, leave it here
 * or you will die a slow and painful death.
 * <p>
 * Oh, by the way: If Elasticsearch decides to upgrade JarHell with new method signatures, we should adapt to these.
