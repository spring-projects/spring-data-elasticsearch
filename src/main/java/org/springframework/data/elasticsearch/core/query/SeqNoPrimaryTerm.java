 * automatically filled with SeqNoPrimaryTerm instance on read operations (like get or search), and also, when the
 * SeqNoPrimaryTerm is not {@literal null} and filled with seq_no and primary_term, they will be sent to Elasticsearch
 * when indexing such an entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This allows to implement optimistic locking pattern for full-update scenario, when an entity is first read from
