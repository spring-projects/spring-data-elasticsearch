= Preface

The Spring Data Elasticsearch project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions using the Elasticsearch Search Engine.
It provides:

* _Templates_ as a high-level abstraction for storing, searching, sorting documents and building aggregations.
* _Repositories_ which for example enable the user to express queries by defining interfaces having customized method names (for basic information about repositories see <<repositories>>).

You will notice similarities to the Spring data solr and mongodb support in the Spring Framework.
