= Upgrading from 5.1.x to 5.2.x

This section describes breaking changes from version 5.1.x to 5.2.x and how removed features can be replaced by new introduced features.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-5.1-5.2.breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

=== Bulk failures
In the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.BulkFailureException` class, the return type of the `getFailedDocuments` is changed from `Map<String, String>`
to `Map<String, FailureDetails>`, which allows to get additional details about failure reasons.

The definition of the `FailureDetails` class (inner to `BulkFailureException`):
[source,java]
public record FailureDetails(Integer status, String errorMessage) {
}

=== scripted and runtime fields

The classes `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.RuntimeField` and `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.ScriptType` have been moved to the subpackage `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query`.

The `type` parameter of the `ScriptData` constructir is not nullable any longer.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-5.1-5.2.deprecations]]
== Deprecations

=== Removal of deprecated code

* All the code using the old deprecated `RestHighLevelClient` has been removed.
The default Elasticsearch client used since version 5.0 is the (not so) new Elasticsearch Java client.
* The `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.ClientLogger` class has been removed.
This logger was configured with the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.WIRE` setting, but was not working with all clients.
From version 5 on, use the trace logger available in the Elasticsearch Java client, see <<elasticsearch.clients.logging>>.
* The method `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ElasticsearchOperations.stringIdRepresentation(Object)` has been removed, use the `convertId(Object)` method defined in the same interface instead.
* The class `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.Range` has been removed, use `org.springframework.data.domain.Range` instead.
* The methods `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.IndexQuery.getParentId() and `setParentId(String)` have been removed, they werent used anymore and were no-ops. It has been removed from the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.IndexQuery` class as well.
