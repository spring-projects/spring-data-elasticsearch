== Breaking Changes

In the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.index.AliasData` class, which is used for alias information 
returned from Elasticsearch, the property `filter` (of type `Document`) is replaced by `filterQuery` which is of type
`org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.Query`.
