= Upgrading from 4.0.x to 4.1.x

This section describes breaking changes from version 4.0.x to 4.1.x and how removed features can be replaced by new introduced features.

== Deprecations

.Definition of the id property
It is possible to define a property of en entity as the id property by naming it either `id` or  `document`.
This behaviour is now deprecated and will produce a warning.
PLease us the `@Id` annotation to mark a property as being the id property.

.Index mappings
In the `ReactiveElasticsearchClient.Indices` interface the `updateMapping` methods are deprecated in favour of the `putMapping` methods.
They do the same, but `putMapping` is consistent with the naming in the Elasticsearch API:

.Alias handling
In the `IndexOperations` interface the methods `addAlias(AliasQuery)`, `removeAlias(AliasQuery)` and `queryForAlias()` have been deprecated.
The new methods `alias(AliasAction)`, `getAliases(String...)` and `getAliasesForIndex(String...)` offer more functionality and a cleaner API.

.Parent-ID
Usage of a parent-id has been removed from Elasticsearch since version 6. We now deprecate the corresponding fields and methods.

== Removals

.Type mappings
The _type mappings_ parameters of the `@Document` annotation and the `IndexCoordinates` object were removed.
They had been deprecated in Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.0 and their values weren't used anymore.

== Breaking Changes

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-4.0-4.1.breaking-changes.returntypes-1]]
=== Return types of ReactiveElasticsearchClient.Indices methods

The methods in the `ReactiveElasticsearchClient.Indices` were not used up to now.
With the introduction of the `ReactiveIndexOperations` it became necessary to change some of the return types:

* the `createIndex`  variants now return a `Mono<Boolean>` instead of a `Mono<Void>` to signal successful index creation.
* the `updateMapping`  variants now return a `Mono<Boolean>` instead of a `Mono<Void>` to signal successful mappings storage.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-4.0-4.1.breaking-changes.returntypes-2]]
=== Return types of DocumentOperations.bulkIndex methods

These methods were returing a `List<String>` containing the ids of the new indexed records.
Now they return a `List<IndexedObjectInformation>`; these objects contain the id and information about optimistic locking (seq_no and primary_term)
