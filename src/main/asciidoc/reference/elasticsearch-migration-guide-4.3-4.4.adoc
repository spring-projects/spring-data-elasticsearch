=== Removal of deprecated classes

==== `ElasticsearchTemplate` has been removed

As of version 4.4 Spring Data Elasticsearch does not use the `TransportClient` from Elasticsearch anymore (which itself is deprecated since Elasticsearch 7.0).
This means that the `ElasticsearchTemplate` class which was deprecated since Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.0 has been removed.
This was the implementation of the `ElasticsearchOperations` interface that was using the `TransportClient`.
Connections to Elasticsearch must be made using either the imperative `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or the reactive `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate`.
