= Upgrading from 4.3.x to 4.4.x

This section describes breaking changes from version 4.3.x to 4.4.x and how removed features can be replaced by new introduced features.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-4.3-4.4.deprecations]]
== Deprecations

=== org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ReactiveElasticsearchOperations

The method `<T> Publisher<T> execute(ClientCallback<Publisher<T>> callback)` has been deprecated.
As there now are multiple implementations using different client libraries the `execute` method is still available in the different implementations, but there is no more method in the interface, because there is no common callback interface for the different clients.

== Breaking Changes

=== Removal of deprecated classes

==== `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ElasticsearchTemplate` has been removed

As of version 4.4 Spring Data Elasticsearch does not use the `TransportClient` from Elasticsearch anymore (which itself is deprecated since Elasticsearch 7.0).
This means that the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ElasticsearchTemplate` class which was deprecated since Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.0 has been removed.
This was the implementation of the `ElasticsearchOperations` interface that was using the `TransportClient`.
Connections to Elasticsearch must be made using either the imperative `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or the reactive `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate`.

=== Package changes

In 4.3 two classes (`ElasticsearchAggregations` and `ElasticsearchAggregation`) had been moved to the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.clients.elasticsearch7` package in preparation for the integration of the new Elasticsearch client.
The were moved back to the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core` package as we keep the classes use the old Elasticsearch client where they were.

=== Behaviour change

The `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate`, when created directly or by Spring Boot configuration had a default refresh policy of IMMEDIATE.
This could cause performance issues on heavy indexing and was different than the default behaviour of Elasticsearch.
This has been changed to that now the default refresh policy is NONE.
When the
`ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` was provided by using the configuration like described in <<elasticsearch.clients.reactive>> the default refresh policy already was set to NONE.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-4.3-4.4.new-clients]]
== New Elasticsearch client

Elasticsearch has introduced it's new `ElasticsearchClient` and has deprecated the previous `RestHighLevelClient`.
Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.4 still uses the old client as the default client for the following reasons:

* The new client forces applications to use the `jakarta.json.spi.JsonProvider` package whereas Spring Boot will stick to `javax.json.spi.JsonProvider` until version 3. So switching the default implementaiton in Spring Data Elasticsearch can only come with Spring Data Elasticsearch 5 (Spring Data 3, Spring 6).
* There are still some bugs in the Elasticsearch client which need to be resolved
* The implementation using the new client in Spring Data Elasticsearch is not yet complete, due to limited resources working on that - remember Spring Data Elasticsearch is a community driven project that lives from public contributions.

=== How to use the new client

CAUTION: The implementation using the new client is not complete, some operations will throw a `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` or might throw NPE (for example when the Elasticsearch cannot parse a response from the server, this still happens sometimes) +
Use the new client to test the implementations but do not use it in productive code yet!

In order to try and use the new client the following steps are necessary:

==== Make sure not to configure the existing default client

If using Spring Boot, exclude Spring Data Elasticsearch from the autoconfiguration

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = ElasticsearchDataAutoConfiguration.class)
public class SpringdataElasticTestApplication {
	// ...
}

----
====

Remove Spring Data Elasticsearch related properties from your application configuration.
If Spring Data Elasticsearch was configured using a programmatic configuration (see <<elastisearch.clients>>), remove these beans from the Spring application context.

==== Add dependencies

The dependencies for the new Elasticsearch client are still optional in Spring Data Elasticsearch so they need to be added explicitly:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>co.elastic.clients</groupId>
        <artifactId>elasticsearch-java</artifactId>
        <version>7.17.3</version>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
                <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-client</artifactId> <!-- is Apache 2-->
        <version>7.17.3</version>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
                <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
====

When using Spring Boot, it is necessary to set the following property in the _pom.xml_.

====
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <jakarta-json.version>2.0.1</jakarta-json.version>
</properties>
----
====

==== New configuration classes

===== Imperative style

In order configure Spring Data Elasticsearch to use the new client, it is necessary to create a configuration bean that derives from `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ElasticsearchConfiguration`:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class NewRestClientConfig extends ElasticsearchConfiguration {

	@Override
	public ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration() {
		return ClientConfiguration.builder() //
			.connectedTo("localhost:9200") //
			.build();
	}
}
----
====

The configuration is done in the same way as with the old client, but it is not necessary anymore to create more than the configuration bean.
With this configuration, the following beans will be available in the Spring application context:

* a `RestClient` bean, that is the configured low level `RestClient` that is used by the Elasticsearch client
* an `ElasticsearchClient` bean, this is the new client that uses the `RestClient`
* an `ElasticsearchOperations` bean, available with the bean names _elasticsearchOperations_ and _elasticsearchTemplate_, this uses the `ElasticsearchClient`

===== Reactive style

To use the new client in a reactive environment the only difference is the class from which to derive the configuration:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class NewRestClientConfig extends ReactiveElasticsearchConfiguration {

	@Override
	public ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration() {
		return ClientConfiguration.builder() //
			.connectedTo("localhost:9200") //
			.build();
	}
}
----
====

With this configuration, the following beans will be available in the Spring application context:

* a `RestClient` bean, that is the configured low level `RestClient` that is used by the Elasticsearch client
* an `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` bean, this is the new reactive client that uses the `RestClient`
* an `ReactiveElasticsearchOperations` bean, available with the bean names _reactiveElasticsearchOperations_ and _reactiveElasticsearchTemplate_, this uses the `ReactiveElasticsearchClient`
