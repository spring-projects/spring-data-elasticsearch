= Upgrading from 5.5.x to 6.0.x

This section describes breaking changes from version 5.5.x to 6.0.x and how removed features can be replaced by new introduced features.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-5.5-6.0.breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

From version 6.0 on, Spring Data Elasticsearch uses the Elasticsearch 9 libraries and as default the new `Rest5Client` provided by these libraries. It is still possible to use the old `RestClient`, check xref:elasticsearch/clients.adoc[Elasticsearch clients] for information. The configuration callbacks for this `RestClient` have been moved from `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ElasticsearchClients` to the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.rest_client.RestClients` class.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-5.5-6.0.deprecations]]
== Deprecations

All the code using the old `RestClient` has been moved to the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.rest_client` package and has been deprecated. Users should switch to the classes from the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.rest5_client` package.


=== Removals

The `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.ScriptType` enum has been removed. To distinguish between an inline and a stored script set the appropriate values in the `org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.query.ScriptData` record.

These methods have been removed because the Elasticsearch Client 9 does not support them anymore:
```
org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchIndicesClient.unfreeze(UnfreezeRequest)
org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchIndicesClient.unfreeze(Function<UnfreezeRequest.Builder, ObjectBuilder<UnfreezeRequest>>)
```
